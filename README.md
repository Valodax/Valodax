🌏 I am an Australian with a Bachelor's of Economics and Data Science, currently living in Spain.

📖 This year I have been building Web3 DApps, writing smart contracts and learning how to use Hardhat.

📽️ Outside the world of tech, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills. My hobbies include reading, photography, video editing and learning Spanish.

🧭 I also love travelling. This year I have been to New Zealand, Spain, France and Peru.
